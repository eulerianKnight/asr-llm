"(1854.44, 1889.13)", Can be deeply skeptical that you'd ever be able to measure anything like that out there and two machines were built in the United States one in Washington State one in Louisiana and as you can see here each of these machines involves two arms basically two tunnels,1854.44,1889.13

"(1893.73, 1894.77)", something like this,1893.73,1894.77
"(1894.77, 1898.87)", and the idea is that light beams are sent down these two tunnels,1894.77,1898.87
